                <p class="center">Pizza is not only delicious but can also be a healthy meal choice when thought is put into its 
                preparation. Though many frozen and fast-food varieties tend to be high in calories, fat, sodium and other unhealthy 
                ingredients, pizza can be made healthier.A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as 
                a pizzaiolo.In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten
                 with the use of a knife and fork</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Bulk foods are food items offered in large quantities, which can be purchased in large, bulk lots or
                 transferred from a bulk container into a smaller container for purchase.Bulk foods may be priced less compared to 
                 packaged foods because they are typically packaged in large generic bulk containers and packaging for grocery 
                 outlets, which utilizes lesser natural resources. Additionally, less packaging is congruent with the environmental 
                 conservation of natural resources and sustainability. One study found a 96% reduction in packaging used for bulk foods
                  compared to packaged foods.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Food Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Online food ordering is the process of ordering food from a website or other application. The product 
                can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen, restaurant, or a ghost kitchen) or food that has not been 
                specially prepared for direction consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, fruits, frozen meats. etc).
                In restaurant-controlled online food ordering, the restaurants create their own website and app, or choose to hire a delivery 
                vendor. </p>
